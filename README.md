# Known Issue
1. The delays are not 100 accurate. 
2. AutoClicker checkbox is bugged when you are on toggle and put a keybind, to fix just click the key you have keybinded once. 

# Maybe Upcoming? 
1. Ghost features, if you are screensharing??!!! 
2. More key options (Mouse, shift, ctrl, alt, etc...)
